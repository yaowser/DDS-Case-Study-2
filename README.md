# DDS-Case-Study-2

This depository is Case Study 2 for Doing Data Science 6306 Section 401 Tuesdays at 9:30 - 11:00 PM EST, Cohort 2017 Spring semester at SMU -- "DDS-Case-Study-2" for short. Author: Yao Yao. This project was submitted through GitHub on RStudio version 1.0.136.

There are 3 directories in this depository: Data, Question 1 Code, and Other with the Paper files in the Root directory

# Reason for analysis

This case study is a cumlative exercise in programming of what we learned in MSDS 6306.

Question 1 covers briefly SAS, python, and R code for matrix creation.

Question 2 is a data exploration of orange trees by type, age, and circumference. Orange is a built-in data set for R.

Question 3 is a data exploration of temperatures in various cities and countries over months and years. City temperature is from CityTemp.csv while country temperature is from Temp.csv.

Question 2 and 3 are an exercise in cleaning and analyzing data using tables and ggplot. R markdown was used to source different data files and the creation of the paper file.

# Root Directory:

"Yao Yao Case Study 2 MSDS 6306 401 Q1.docx" is the document file to capture the code and the screenshot outputs for question 1.

"Yao Yao Case Study 2 MSDS 6306 401 Q2 and Q3.Rmd" is the R markdown file that is fully follows the rubric of annotating code for analysis with conclusive statements

"Yao_Yao_Case_Study_2_MSDS_6306_401_Q2_and_Q3.pdf" is the final knitted paper that combines text, code, and output into one conclusive file ready for submission

"DDS-Case-Study-2.Rproj" is the R project file for Rstudio
